# Geospatial Visualization of USGS Data

This project visualizes and analyzes **USGS (U.S. Geological Survey)** geospatial data using Python.  
It demonstrates how to process, clean, and display spatial data interactively through mapping libraries such as **GeoPandas**, **Folium**, **Plotly**, and **PyDeck**.

## Project Overview
This notebook was developed as part of the **Tuwaiq Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (Week 2 - Day 15)**.  
The goal is to explore geospatial data and visualize spatial patterns through heatmaps and density plots.

## Features
- Load and preprocess USGS geospatial data  
- Split and merge coordinate and feature data  
- Convert data to GeoDataFrame  
- Create:
  - Interactive **Folium maps**
  - **Plotly density maps**
  - **PyDeck 3D heatmaps**
- Export data to **GeoJSON** format

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
